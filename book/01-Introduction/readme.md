one of the frustrating things for me with the JavaScript ecosystem is how
much it seems to work against the nature of the language itself. the real 
beauty of JavaScript is it's **dynamic** nature, yet "modern" JavaScript
seems to be all about creating very well defined and strict api's with
strict static typing using TypeScript. module resolution is hidden away.
the event loop is hidden away. FFI is generally painful etc.

the main goal of this runtime is to fully embrace the dynamic nature of 
JavaScript and give full control back to the developers using the runtime.
