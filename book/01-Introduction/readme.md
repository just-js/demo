One of the frustrations I encounter in the JavaScript ecosystem is its apparent divergence from the inherent nature of the language. The true beauty of JavaScript lies in its dynamic nature, yet 'modern' JavaScript often focuses on crafting highly defined and strict APIs with rigorous static typing through TypeScript. Module resolution, event loop intricacies, and FFI complexities are often obscured. The primary objective of this runtime is to wholeheartedly embrace JavaScript's dynamic essence and restore complete control to developers utilizing the runtime.
